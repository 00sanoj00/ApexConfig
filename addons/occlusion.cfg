// These settings will change the way the game sounds by entirely disabling
// occlusion. This particularly matters around objects, walls, etc. Occlusion,
// in reference to sound, will typically reduce the amount of noise the observer
// hears when there are objects between them.

miles_nonactor_occlusion 0 // Don't do traces to determine when non-entity sounds are occluded
miles_occlusion 0 // Don't perform occlusion checks
miles_occlusion_force 0 // Force all sounds to have occlusion values of 0 (unoccluded)
miles_occlusion_partial 0 // Binary occlusion state
