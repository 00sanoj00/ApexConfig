# Tsunami's Minimal Apex Legends Config
## Which configs should I use?
* autorun.cfg - This makes sprint a toggle versus hold and allows you to sprint out of ADS (Written by Anutim)
* hudtweaks.cfg - This introduces some HUD changes, such as transparent HUD backgrounds, rotating minimap, semi-transparent pings, and grenade/health to activate on press from wheels. These are purely preference and offer no FPS gains.
* toaster.cfg - This config will make your game look **noticeably** worse with a trade-off of higher FPS. Use this if you need more frames.

## How to Use
1. To download the scripts, click the green 'Clone or Download' button, and then click 'Download ZIP'.
2. Drop autoexec.cfg into Apex Legend's cfg folder (Typically located at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Origin Games\Apex\cfg`)
3. If you choose to use any of the additional configs, you **must** create a folder named `addons` in your cfg folder.
4. If using any additional configs, drop them in the `addons` folder.
5. Add `+exec autoexec` to your launch options (Access this by hitting the gear cog in Origin for Apex and then going to Game Properties->Advanced Launch Options)
