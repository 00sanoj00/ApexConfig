# Tsunami's Minimal Apex Legends Config

**As of patch 1.2, most config commands received a flag explicitly disabling them. As a result, this config currently won't achieve much anymore. While it is a [known issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/bxbaer/known_issues_post_patch_12/), the first patch following this only reenabled three commands. While custom resolution commands were reenabled, they remain the only advantage to running a config anymore.**

## Which configs should I use?
* hudtweaks.cfg - This introduces some HUD changes, such as rotating minimap, semi-transparent pings, and grenade/health to activate on press from wheels. These are purely preference and offer no FPS gains. **Recommended**

## How to Use
1. To download the scripts, click the green 'Clone or Download' button, and then click 'Download ZIP'.
2. Drop autoexec.cfg into Apex Legend's cfg folder (Typically located at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Origin Games\Apex\cfg`)
3. If you choose to use any of the additional configs, you **must** create a folder named `addons` in your cfg folder.
4. If using any additional configs, drop them in the `addons` folder.
5. Add `+exec autoexec` to your launch options (Access this by hitting the gear cog in Origin for Apex and then going to Game Properties->Advanced Launch Options)

## Important Notes
1. To reset settings, you will either have to flip the values back to their defaults and relaunch, or reinstall the game. In the near future I will provide a config that does just this.
